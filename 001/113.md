# The `startDraw` function can be called after the Prize Pool has become shutdown, causing a loss of funds

## Summary
Once the Prize Pool has been shut down no draws can ever be awarded. The issue is that the `startDraw` function in the `DrawManager` contract can still be called, causing a loss of funds for the claimers.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a claimer calls the `startDraw` function they are required to make a call to Witnet in order to make a request for randomness. This request is not free to make as it requires for a fee to be paid. Therefore, if a claimer makes a call to `startDraw` after the Prize Pool has been shut down they will not be able to claim the expected rewards for completing a start draw auction and will have lost the funds used to make the request for randomness.

## Impact
Loss of funds for claimers
