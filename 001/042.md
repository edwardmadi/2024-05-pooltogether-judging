# A new draw cannot be finished if the lastStartDrawAuction's rngRequestId is void

## Summary
A new draw cannot be finished if the lastStartDrawAuction's rngRequestId is void

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in `DrawManager.startDraw()`

When a user calls `startDraw` for a new draw, the function will first clear the `_startDrawAuctions` array AND THEN push the StartDrawAuction data onto the array. See below

```solidity
function startDraw(address _rewardRecipient, uint32 _rngRequestId) external returns (uint24) {
    ...
    ...
    if (lastRequest.drawId != drawId) { // if this request is for a new draw 
      // auctioned opened at the close of the draw
      auctionOpenedAt = closesAt;
      // clear out the old ones
      while (_startDrawAuctions.length > 0) {
        _startDrawAuctions.pop();
      }
    ...
    ...
    _startDrawAuctions.push(StartDrawAuction({
      recipient: _rewardRecipient,
      closedAt: uint40(block.timestamp),
      drawId: drawId,
      rngRequestId: _rngRequestId
    }));
    ...
    ...
```

The protocol implements a system where if the `lastRequest` is for the same draw THEN if the `lastRequest.rngRequestId failed` a user can push another StartDrawAuction data onto the array

This is important so that if the previous request failed, a user can start a draw with another request

```solidity
function startDraw(address _rewardRecipient, uint32 _rngRequestId) external returns (uint24) {
    ...
    ...
    } else { // the old request is for the same draw
      if (!rng.isRequestFailed(lastRequest.rngRequestId)) { // if the request failed 
        revert AlreadyStartedDraw();
    ...
    ...
```

The problem is that the check does not account for the `Void` state that a request may be in, it is equivalent to the errored state therefore if the `lastRequest` is Void THEN a user should be able to start a draw with another request, but this is not the case.

The issue is that the `isRequestFailed` call will return false if the request is `void`, this will cause the revert to take place and prevent pushing another StartDrawAuction data onto the array.

`isRequestFailed` function returns the following

```solidity
return witnetRandomness.witnet().getQueryResponseStatus(witnetQueryId) == WitnetV2.ResponseStatus.Error
```

Looking into the `getQueryResponseStatus` ==> `seekQueryResponseStatus` function in the `WitnetOracle` contract we see that it can return the previously described void state

```solidity
function seekQueryResponseStatus(uint256 queryId) internal view returns (WitnetV2.ResponseStatus) {
        ...
        ...
        } else {
            return WitnetV2.ResponseStatus.Void;
        }
    }
```

Therefore `isRequestFailed` will return false if the status is Void



## Impact
Since the draw has a RNG request in a void state it will not be able to be finished

If the RNG request is void, the current system will not allow users to try start the draw again with a new request (which is the intended behavior)

## Recommendation
This is a low likelihood scenario and it will be difficult to create a solution that does not introduce other vulnerabilities.
