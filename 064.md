# `liquidationPair` is able to add any number of `_yieldFee`

## Summary
The `PrizeVault` has ann issue where the `liquidationPair` can artificially inflate the `yieldFeeBalance` which can result in loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
First of all, let's take a look at this function:

The `_withdraw` function has two conditions that determine whether it performs any actions:

1. If `_assets > _latentAssets`, it redeems shares from the yieldVault.
If `_receiver != address(this)`, it transfers _assets to _receiver.

If neither condition is met, the function does nothing.

```solidity
function _withdraw(address _receiver, uint256 _assets) internal {
        // The vault accumulates dust from rounding errors over time, so if we can fulfill the withdrawal from the
        // latent balance, we don't need to redeem any yield vault shares.
        uint256 _latentAssets = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (_assets > _latentAssets) {
            // The latent balance is subtracted from the withdrawal so we don't withdraw more than we need.
            uint256 _yieldVaultShares = yieldVault.previewWithdraw(_assets - _latentAssets);
            // Assets are sent to this contract so any leftover dust can be redeposited later.
            yieldVault.redeem(_yieldVaultShares, address(this), address(this));
        }
        if (_receiver != address(this)) {
            _asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, _assets);
        }
    }
```

The `transferTokensOut` function makes a call to the `_withdraw` function above:

```solidity
function transferTokensOut(
        address /* sender */,
        address _receiver,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint256 _amountOut
    ) external virtual onlyLiquidationPair returns (bytes memory) {
        if (_amountOut == 0) revert LiquidationAmountOutZero();

        uint256 _totalDebtBefore = totalDebt();
        uint256 _availableYield = _availableYieldBalance(totalPreciseAssets(), _totalDebtBefore);
        uint32 _yieldFeePercentage = yieldFeePercentage;

        // Determine the proportional yield fee based on the amount being liquidated:
        uint256 _yieldFee;
        if (_yieldFeePercentage != 0) {
            // The yield fee is calculated as a portion of the total yield being consumed, such that 
            // `total = amountOut + yieldFee` and `yieldFee / total = yieldFeePercentage`. 
            _yieldFee = (_amountOut * FEE_PRECISION) / (FEE_PRECISION - _yieldFeePercentage) - _amountOut;
        }

        // Ensure total liquidation amount does not exceed the available yield balance:
        if (_amountOut + _yieldFee > _availableYield) {
            revert LiquidationExceedsAvailable(_amountOut + _yieldFee, _availableYield);
        }

        // Increase yield fee balance:
        if (_yieldFee > 0) {
----->            yieldFeeBalance = yieldFeeBalance + _yieldFee;
        }

        // Mint or withdraw amountOut to `_receiver`:
        if (_tokenOut == address(_asset)) {
            _enforceMintLimit(_totalDebtBefore, _yieldFee);
----->            _withdraw(_receiver, _amountOut);
        } else if (_tokenOut == address(this)) {
            _enforceMintLimit(_totalDebtBefore, _amountOut + _yieldFee);
            _mint(_receiver, _amountOut);
        } else {
            revert LiquidationTokenOutNotSupported(_tokenOut);
        }

        emit TransferYieldOut(msg.sender, _tokenOut, _receiver, _amountOut, _yieldFee);

        return "";
    }
```

Now, `_receiver` can be specified as any value. If `_receiver` is specified as `address(this)` :

The second `if` in the `_withdraw` function does not satisfy the condition, _receiver == address(this)
i.e _(When calling `transferTokensOut`; specifying `tokenOut = address(_asset)`, the `_withdraw` function will be called)
The attacker can transfer a certain amount of `_asset` to `address(this)`, and the value of `_latentAssets` in the `_withdraw` function can be controlled by the attacker.

The attacker passes `_assets` with a value less than `_latentAssets`:
The second `if` in the `_withdraw` function does not satisfy the condition, _assets <= _latentAssets.

When `_withdraw` does nothing, [calling `transferTokensOut` simply increases the value of the yieldFeeBalance:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/main/pt-v5-vault/src/PrizeVault.sol#L739-L742
)

```solidity
 // Increase yield fee balance:
        if (_yieldFee > 0) {
            yieldFeeBalance = yieldFeeBalance + _yieldFee;
        }
```


This allows an attacker to repeatedly call `transferTokensOut` and increase the `yieldFeeBalance` 
## Impact
`liquidationPair` adds any amount of yield fees, resulting in the loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `transferTokensout` like this:

```diff
      function transferTokensOut(
      .....  
-      if (_tokenOut == address(_asset)) {
+    if (_tokenOut == address(_asset) && _receiver != address(this)) {
            _enforceMintLimit(_totalDebtBefore, _yieldFee);
            _withdraw(_receiver, _amountOut);
        } else if (_tokenOut == address(this)) {
            _enforceMintLimit(_totalDebtBefore, _amountOut + _yieldFee);
            _mint(_receiver, _amountOut);
        } else {
            revert LiquidationTokenOutNotSupported(_tokenOut);
        }
```
