# Prize winners can set claim hooks to revert `claimPrize` from others to save the claim rewards.

## Summary
Prize winners can set claim hooks to revert `claimPrize` from others, and then they `claimPrize` themselves with 0 claim reward. Winners have the incentive to do so as this will save the claim reward. However, this will discourage other normal claimers to claim prizes.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Prize Claimer contract allows anyone to claim prizes on behalf of winners, and earn rewards in doing so. The calling path to claim prizes is `Claimer.claimPrizes => Claimer._claim => Claimable.claimPrize => PrizePool.claimPrize`. `Claimer.claimPrizes` will calculate the claim rewards and the rewards will be added to the claim reward recipient's account (L563). Note that the claim rewards are paid out of the winner's prize (L566), then the remaining prize is transferd to the `_prizeRecipient` (L590).
```solidity
// Function: PrizePool.claimPrize()

560:    uint256 amount;
561:    if (_claimReward != 0) {
562:      emit IncreaseClaimRewards(_claimRewardRecipient, _claimReward);
563:@>    _rewards[_claimRewardRecipient] += _claimReward;
564:
565:      unchecked {
566:@>      amount = tierLiquidity.prizeSize - _claimReward;
567:      }
568:    } else {
569:      amount = tierLiquidity.prizeSize;
570:    }
571:
572:    // co-locate to save gas
573:    claimCount++;
574:    _totalWithdrawn = SafeCast.toUint128(_totalWithdrawn + amount);
575:    _totalRewardsToBeClaimed = SafeCast.toUint104(_totalRewardsToBeClaimed + _claimReward);
...    // ...
589:    if (amount > 0) {
590:@>    prizeToken.safeTransfer(_prizeRecipient, amount);
591:    }
```

Each account is allowed to set claim hooks that can be called when they win. The hooks are called in `Claimable.claimPrize`, before or after `PrizePool.claimPrize`. In such case, a winner can set an after claim hook, and the hook reverts the `claimPrize` if the claim reward (i.e. `_reward`) is not 0. The winner listens for this revert event, and then calls `Claimer.claimPrizes` himself to claim his own prize with 0 claim reward. In such case, the winner can save the claim reward, and gains the total prize.
```solidity
// Function: Claimable.claimPrize()

100:        uint256 _prizeTotal = prizePool.claimPrize(
101:            _winner,
102:            _tier,
103:            _prizeIndex,
104:            _prizeRecipient,
105:            _reward,
106:            _rewardRecipient
107:        );
108:
109:        if (_hooks[_winner].useAfterClaimPrize) {
110:@>          _hooks[_winner].implementation.afterClaimPrize{ gas: HOOK_GAS }(
111:                _winner,
112:                _tier,
113:                _prizeIndex,
114:                _prizeTotal - _reward,
115:                _prizeRecipient,
116:                _hookData
117:            );
118:        }
```

Winners have the incentive to do so as this will save the claim reward. However, this will discourage other normal claimers to claim prizes.

## Impact
Winners can set claim hook to revert others' `claimPrize` to save claim rewards. This discourages other normal claimers to claim prizes. The worst case scenario is that the incentive mechanism may be destroyed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Due to the presence of claim hooks, I am unable to devise a good solution to this problem. Perhaps removing the claim hooks could be considered.
