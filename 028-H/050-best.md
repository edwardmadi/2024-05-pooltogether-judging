# Attackers can create invalid observations by contributing 0 PrizeToken, causing getDisbursedBetween to return incorrect values.

## Summary

Attackers can create invalid observations by contributing 0 PrizeToken, causing getDisbursedBetween to return incorrect values.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function contributePrizeTokens allows user to contribute 0 PrizeToken. When itâ€™s the first contribution, an observation is created with both available and disbursed being 0. However, the cardinality will be increased by 1.

As for function getDisbursedBetween, when looking for `atOrAfterStart`, the observation corresponding to _startDrawId is obtained by default first. However, when the available and disbursed are all 0, It will use binary search and `atOrAfterStart` will be `_accumulator.observations[afterOrAtDrawId]`.

```solidity
    Observation memory atOrAfterStart;
    if (_startDrawId <= oldestDrawId || ringBufferInfo.cardinality == 1) {
      atOrAfterStart = _accumulator.observations[oldestDrawId];
    } else {
      // check if the start draw has an observation, otherwise search for the earliest observation after
      atOrAfterStart = _accumulator.observations[_startDrawId];
      if (atOrAfterStart.available == 0 && atOrAfterStart.disbursed == 0) {
        (, , , uint24 afterOrAtDrawId) = binarySearch(
          _accumulator.drawRingBuffer,
          oldestIndex,
          newestIndex,
          ringBufferInfo.cardinality,
          _startDrawId
        );
        atOrAfterStart = _accumulator.observations[afterOrAtDrawId];
      }
    }
```

There is a problem here. For example, when _startDrawId is equal to 1, the observation directly obtained is the result of the attacker making 0 contribution.

```solidity
atOrAfterStart = _accumulator.observations[_startDrawId];
```

Therefore, a binary search is performed, and the two DrawId obtained are 1 and 2. But here the latter (DrawId=2) will be directly selected as the result.

```solidity
(, , , uint24 afterOrAtDrawId) = binarySearch(
...
atOrAfterStart = _accumulator.observations[afterOrAtDrawId];
```

Finally, the function getDisbursedBetween calculates a smaller result than expected.

## Impact

Function getDisbursedBetween calculates a smaller result than expected, causing some prizeTokens are locked.
