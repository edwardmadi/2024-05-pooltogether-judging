# Gas Manipulation by Malicious Winners in claimPrizes Function

## Summary

A malicious winner can exploit the `claimPrizes` function in the `Claimer` contract by reverting the transaction through returning a huge data chunk. This manipulation can cause the transaction to run out of gas, preventing legitimate claims and allowing the malicious user to claim prizes without computing winners.

## Vulnerability Detail

- The `Claimer` contract allows users to claim prizes on behalf of others by calling the `claimPrizes` function.
- A malicious winner can exploit this function by returning a huge data chunk when called, causing the transaction's gas to be too high and revert.
- Although the function catches the revert, the remaining gas (63/64 of the original gas) is likely insufficient for the rest of the claims.
- The malicious winner can then replay the transaction to claim the fees from the first claimer's computation without needing to compute the winners themselves.

## Impact

- Legitimate claimers may lose gas fees due to transaction reverts caused by malicious winners.
- Malicious winners can exploit this to claim prizes without computing winners, undermining the fairness of the prize distribution.

## Recommendation

- Implement a gas limit check to ensure that sufficient gas remains for the rest of the claims after catching a revert.
- Consider adding a mechanism to penalize or blacklist addresses that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
