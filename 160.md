# [M-1] Users can deposit ERC 20 not accounted by any `LiquidationPair` and potentially freezing the deposits to the `PrizePool`

## Summary
An ERC20's yield can not be liquidated if there is no `LiquidationPair`.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user can deposit into the vault an ERC20 to be deposited into an ERC4626 to generate yield, such yield is to be liquidated by a `LiquidationPair`, but if no liquidator includes said ERC20 as `__tokenIn`, it's yield, can not be liquidated, and therefor it can not be deposited into `PrizePool.sol`, worst case scenario, the share `_mintLimit` can be reached with this unliquidatable token, meaning that the vault can be frozen if the user refuse to withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check on the `deposit` function to prevent deposit of an unliquidatable token.
