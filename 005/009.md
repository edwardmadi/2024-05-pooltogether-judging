# The `maxDeposit()` function is not ERC4626 compliant

## Summary
The `maxDeposit()` function is not ERC4626 compliant

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol has clearly stated the following
>PrizeVaults are expected to strictly comply with the ERC4626 standard.

According to the official [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard, the following must hold for the `maxDeposit()` function
>MUST return the maximum amount of assets deposit would allow to be deposited for receiver and not cause a revert

The problem is that the `maxDeposit()` function uses `yieldVault.maxDeposit(address(this))` to determine maximum deposit amount

BUT the `_depositAndMint` function uses `yieldVault.mint(_yieldVaultShares, address(this))`

If the `yieldVault.mint()` function has a lower limit than `yieldVault.deposit()`, then depositing the value returned from `maxDeposit()` will revert.

## Impact
There may be issues related to vault integration

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Redesign the function so that it is compliant.

or

The protocol should analyze if this non compliance poses a big risk, if not just let it be and acknowledge the function is not ERC4626 compliant.
