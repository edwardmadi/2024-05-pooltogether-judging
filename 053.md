# Missing `notShutdown` modifier in `claimPrize`

## Summary
The `claimPrize` function in PrizePool allows users to claim prizes even after the prize pool has been shutdown.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimPrize` function does not include the `notShutdown` modifier, which means that it does not check if the prize pool has been shutdown before allowing a prize to be claimed. This can lead to a situation where users can still claim prizes even after the prize pool has been shut down, which may not be the intended behavior.

## Impact
Prizes can still be claimed even when the prize pool is shut down

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `notShutdown` modifier to the `claimPrize` function. This modifier should check if the prize pool has been shutdown and revert if it is the case. 

```diff
    function claimPrize(
    address _winner,
    uint8 _tier,
    uint32 _prizeIndex,
    address _prizeRecipient,
    uint96 _claimReward,
    address _claimRewardRecipient
+ ) external notShutdown returns (uint256) {
}
```
