# When the total Draw Auction Rewards exceeds availableRewards, `finishDraw` will fail.

## Summary

When the total Draw Auction Rewards exceeds availableRewards, `finishDraw` will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `finishDraw` is used to award the prize pool and pay out rewards. The reward for each auction is calculated based on the ElapsedTime between DrawAuctions. The longer the ElapsedTime, the higher the reward. However, since `_startDrawAuctions` may contain multiple Auctions, the accumulated rewards may exceed `availableRewards`, causing the function execution to fail.

## Impact

finishDraw may be DOSed.
