# `DrawManager::finishDraw()` may hand out more rewards than the reserve if RNG requests fail

## Summary

`DrawManager::finishDraw()` calculates reward fractions for each tried auction within a draw, but does not verify if the total fraction is bigger than the reserve, leading to the failure of some draws.

## Vulnerability Detail

`DrawManager::startDraw()` is the entrypoint to start draw actions and hands out rewards according to the curve in the [docs](https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/design/draw-auction#parabolic-fractional-dutch-auction-pfda). The target reward fraction is a fraction of the reserve, so a number between 0 and 1. Considering for example that the start reward fraction is 0.25, the finish fraction (there is an auction to finish the draw by calling `DrawManager::finishDraw()`) is 0.25 and there are 2 retries, if the first 2 requests fail but the third succeeds, the reward fraction will exceed 1 and `DrawManager::finishDraw()` will revert due to withdrawing more from the reserve than possible.
For example, in the scenario above, assuming the draws are executed slightly later than the target time, the total reward fraction is 0.251 + 0.251 + 0.251 + 0.251 = 1.004, so it tries to fetch more from the reserve than possible and reverts in `PrizePool::allocateRewardFromReserve()`, 
```solidity
if (_amount > _reserve) {
  revert InsufficientReserve(_amount, _reserve);
}
```
This is less likely to happen if the reserve is bigger than `maxRewards` in the `DrawManager`, but even then it may still happen. If the reserve is smaller than `maxRewards`, it is more likely.

## Impact

Failed draws due to not limiting the rewards fraction to 1, as it underflows in `PrizePool::allocateRewardFromReserve()`.

## Recommendation

Limit the reward fraction to `1`, for example by dividing pro-rata to the excess of the total reward fraction. For example, if the total is 1.1, each reward fraction may be decreased 1.1 times to not make the draw revert.
