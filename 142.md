# Incorrect implementation of `drawTimeout`

## Summary
Incorrect implementation of `drawTimeout`

## Vulnerability Detail
Draw timeout is implemented incorrectly. Draw timeout is supposed to be the number of draws that can be missed: 
`The maximum number of draws that can be missed before the prize pool is considered inactive.`

But the implementation is incorrect. Since a draw can only be awarded after the draw's completion, even when no draw has been missed, the implementation will consider this as a missed draw and hence will shutdown the prize pool. For eg: in case the drawTimeout is set to 1, then it will for sure be shutdown since the next draw can only be awarded after (closingTime(prevAwardedDrawID + 1))

## Impact
User's creating vaults based on the documentation above will have 1 draw reduced from the expected
