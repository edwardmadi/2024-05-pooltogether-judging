# Winners in `Claimable` may game claimer bots by claiming the prize when the `beforeHook` is called on the hook

## Summary

`Claimer::claimPrizes()` goes through a list of winners and prizes and claims prizes from the `PrizePool` on behalf of users, but winners may exploit the hook available in `Claimable` to always steal the fee of the `Claimer` bot.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Claimer::claimPrizes()` is called by bots, who sponsor prize claiming for users in return of prize fees given by the VRGDA auction in `Claimer`. 

Each `PrizeVault` inherits the `Claimable` contract, which allows winners setting a hook to any smart contract in their control, which is called before and after prizes from the `PrizePool` are claimed.

However, this hook allows malicious winners to completely steal the fees of the claimer bots in the `beforeHook` hook by claiming the prize in the hook itself. Thus, the claimer bot is paying the gas costs, but winners guarantee that the claiming fees go to them. The `PrizePool::claimPrize()` reverts for the claimer bot as it was already claimed, but the transaction still goes through as it is wrapped in a try/catch statement in `Claimer::_claim()`.

Malicious winners may frontrun the claimer bot and set a new hook that implements the malicious logic so bots are tricked.

## Impact

Claimer fees are completely gamed by malicious winners that frontrun claimer bots and claim the fees for themselves in the `beforeHook`.

## Recommendation

Implement a reentrancy lock to not allow before hooks reentering and stealing the fees of the claimer bots.
