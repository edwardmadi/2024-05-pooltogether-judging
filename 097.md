# The accumulated balance in the `TwabController` will overflow for tokens with a bigger number of decimals, leading to lost funds

## Summary

The accumulated balance in the observations of the `TwabController` will overflow given enough time for tokens with enough decimal places, such as [$ERBB](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5702a4487da07c827cde512e2d5969cb430cd839#code), which has 27.

## Vulnerability Detail

The observations in the `TwabController` are stored as `uint128`, as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/main/pt-v5-twab-controller/src/libraries/ObservationLib.sol#L30). Thus, the maximum value is 2^128 - 1 â‰ƒ 3.4e38.

Considering the $ERBB token, which has 27 decimals and a price of 1.31 USD at the [time](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x8d7625fcf354c0961ac51fc121b9dd1708d6b226/) of writing, if 1 year passes, the remaining precision for the token balance is `(2^128 - 1) / (365*24*3600) / 1e27 = 10800` tokens, or approximately 14148 USD at a price of 1.31.

Thus, with tokens such as $ERBB, the accumulated balance will overflow whenever users try to withdraw. It will not be possible to do anything as the accumulated balance is extrapolated to the current time, which means that it may not overflow when minting, but then overflow on burns due to the balance accruing over time.

As PrizeVaults can be built by anyone there is not any restriction on the tokens in scope and it is expected that users create vaults with tokens with more decimals than 18.

## Impact

DoSed withdrawals and stuck funds due to the accumulated balance overflow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

Vscode

## Recommendation

The accumulated balance should be stored in a variable bigger than `uint128`.
