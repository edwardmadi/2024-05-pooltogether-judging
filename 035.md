# DOS of claimprize function in the PrizePool.sol+ Loss of Tokens

## Summary
DOS of claimprize function in the PrizePool.sol
## Vulnerability Detail
claimPrize function cant be called without difference in _totalAccumulator variable and DONATOR vaults accumulator Front run can causes further DOS of the claimPrize function and loss of users prizeTokens.
## Impact

## Code Snippet

The totalSupply being equal to 0 causes the exploit.

Unless this function is called with a _priceVault not equal to the DONATOR nobody will be able to call the claim Prize function in this contract but as there is no safe way to call this without being front run its left vulnerable to DOS.

Not only that the function causes the loss of _prizeTokens meaning the person contributing will either have to get or mint more of _prizeTokens to the contract possibly causing depreciation in _prizeTokens value.
example test of exploit:

```solidity
function testfrontrunexploitpreventingclaimprize() public {
    prizeToken.mint(address(prizePool), 100e18);
    vm.prank(address(1));
    prizePool.contributePrizeTokens(prizePool.DONATOR(), 100e18);
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.expectRevert();
    prizePool.contributePrizeTokens(address(this), 100e18);
    awardDraw(1);
    mockTwab(address(this), msg.sender, 0);
    vm.expectRevert();
    uint256 prize = claimPrize(msg.sender, 0, 0);
    assertEq(prizePool.accountedBalance(), 100e18 - prize);
 }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
replace the contributePrizeToken function with 

function donatePrizeTokens(uint256 _amount, address _prizeVault) external {
    prizeToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    contributePrizeTokens(_prizeVault, _amount);
  }
Stopping the front running.
If you do not want to transfer no tokens to a different vault to call claimPrize you should make a case for the totalContributed in here:

If totalContributed is 0 which causes the divide by 0 error in the first place.
