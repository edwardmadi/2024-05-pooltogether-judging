# vault contributed to prize pool at shutdown time will lose their prizes

## Summary
vaults that contributed at shutdown draw cannot participate in claiming their prizes, so they will lose them
## Vulnerability Detail
only vaults from `computeRangeStartDrawIdInclusive(drawIdPriorToShutdown, grandPrizePeriodDraws)` to `getShutdownDrawId() - 1` can withdraw prizes, any vaults that contributed at shutdown will lose it
```solidity
  function computeShutdownPortion(address _vault, address _account) public view returns (ShutdownPortion memory) {
    uint24 drawIdPriorToShutdown = getShutdownDrawId() - 1;
    uint24 startDrawIdInclusive = computeRangeStartDrawIdInclusive(drawIdPriorToShutdown, grandPrizePeriodDraws); 

    (uint256 vaultContrib, uint256 totalContrib) = _getVaultShares(
      _vault,
      startDrawIdInclusive,
      drawIdPriorToShutdown
    );
...
  }
```
[src/PrizePool.sol#L874](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/main/pt-v5-prize-pool/src/PrizePool.sol#L874)

Vaults will take/claim their contribution here due to observation being updated on the contribution and they can claim it.
```solidity
  function shutdownBalanceOf(address _vault, address _account) public returns (uint256) {

    Observation memory newestObs = _totalAccumulator.newestObservation();
    balance += (newestObs.available + newestObs.disbursed) - (withdrawalObservation.available + withdrawalObservation.disbursed);

    return (shutdownPortion.numerator * balance) / shutdownPortion.denominator;
  }
```

## Impact
Vaults that contribute prizes at shutdown draw unfairly cannot get their prizes
