# PrizeVault:transferTokensOut miscalculates the yield fee

## Summary
The transferTokensOut at the PrizeVault contract currently calculates yield fee percentages wrong.
## Vulnerability Detail
The transferTokensOut function currently does the following calculation to get yield fee:
```solidity
function transferTokensOut(
        address /* sender */,
        address _receiver,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint256 _amountOut
    ) {
    ...
    // Determine the proportional yield fee based on the amount being liquidated:
        uint256 _yieldFee;
        if (_yieldFeePercentage != 0) {
            // The yield fee is calculated as a portion of the total yield being consumed, such that 
            // `total = amountOut + yieldFee` and `yieldFee / total = yieldFeePercentage`. 
            
            _yieldFee = (_amountOut * FEE_PRECISION) / (FEE_PRECISION - _yieldFeePercentage) - _amountOut;
        }
    ...
    
    }
```

The logic is incorrect. If we break down both mathematical expressions at the developer comment, we can see the written expression is impossible:
```solidity
// `total = amountOut + yieldFee` and `yieldFee / total = yieldFeePercentage`. 
```

Given the relationships:

total = amountOut + yieldFee
yieldFee / total = yieldFeePercentage

From these relationships, we can deduce the correct formula.

### Derivation:
From the second relationship, we get:
yieldFee = yieldFeePercentage * total

Substitute the expression for total:
yieldFee = yieldFeePercentage * (amountOut + yieldFee)

Rearrange to solve for yieldFee:
yieldFee = yieldFeePercentage * amountOut + yieldFeePercentage * yieldFee

Isolate yieldFee:
yieldFee - yieldFeePercentage * yieldFee = yieldFeePercentage * amountOut

Factor out yieldFee:
yieldFee * (1 - yieldFeePercentage) = yieldFeePercentage * amountOut

Finally, solve for yieldFee:
yieldFee = (yieldFeePercentage * amountOut) / (1 - yieldFeePercentage)
## Impact
As we can see, the current expression doesn't multiply the numerator by yieldFeePercentage.
All YieldFee calculations at the transferTokensOut function yield wrong results

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to factor yieldFeePercentage in when calculating the yield fees. The following snippet contains a possible correction for the issue:
```solidity
function transferTokensOut(
        address /* sender */,
        address _receiver,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint256 _amountOut
    ) {
    ...
    uint256 _yieldFee;
    if (_yieldFeePercentage != 0) {
        // Calculate yield fee using the derived formula:
        // yieldFee = (yieldFeePercentage * amountOut) / (1 - yieldFeePercentage)
        
        // Applying FEE_PRECISION to handle the percentage calculation accurately:
        _yieldFee = (_yieldFeePercentage * _amountOut ) / (FEE_PRECISION - _yieldFeePercentage);
    }
    ...
}
```
