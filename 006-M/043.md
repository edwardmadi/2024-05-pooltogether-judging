# witnet doesn't support avalanche chain

## Summary
witnet doesn't support avalanche chain
## Vulnerability Detail
checking contest readme Avalanche chain happens to be among the chains the codebase will be deployed on.
```java
On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

The contracts are deployed on Optimism and Base.

We also plan on deploying to:

Arbitrum
Ethereum
Gnosis
Blast
Linea
Scroll
zkSync
Avalanche
Polygon
Zerion

```

Now checking witnet Docs Avalanche chain happens to be among 1 of the various chains with upcoming support

Platform | Networks | Progress
-- | -- | --
Algorand | testnetmainnet | TBD
Aurora | testnetmainnet | TBD
Avalanche | Subnets | TBD
Gnosis Chain (xDAI) | mainnet | ETA: 2023 Q3
Harmony | mainnet | TBD
Hiro | Â  | TBD
Solana | devnetmainnet | TBD


## Impact
witnet doesn't support avalanche chain hence the protocol won't be able to use it on Avalanche chain.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Team should decide on how best to handle this issue.

They could look for another means to generate randomness on Avalanche chain
