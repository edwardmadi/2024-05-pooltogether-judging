# `Claimer::claimPrizes()` and `Claimer::computeTotalFees()` do not validate the intended `drawId`, which may incur significant costs for claimer bots

## Summary

`Claimer::claimPrizes()` and `Claimer::computeTotalFees()` do not validate the intended `drawId`, which will punish bots that claim prizes at the very of the `drawId`, but their transaction only gets included after the `drawId` ends, not claiming any prize, but still incurring gas costs.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Claimer::claimPrizes()` and `Claimer::computeTotalFees()` get the elapsed time based on `block.timestamp - prizePool.lastAwardedDrawAwardedAt()`. The problem with this approach is that the `draw` may be over for the intended `drawId`, but the next `draw` has not yet been awarded, so the elapsed time will actually be bigger than a full draw duration and bots expect to receive more fees.

However, whenever bots submit a `Claimer::claimPrizes()` transaction a few blocks before the end of the draw, the transaction may be delayed to be included by just a few blocks and the right `drawId` would be over. It will not revert initially due to the `_minFeePerClaim` check as the elapsed time is based on `block.timestamp - prizePool.lastAwardedDrawAwardedAt()`, as mentioned above, so it will return more than the specified minimum fee, but the `draw` may be over.

Thus, such users will incur significant costs without receiving any fee as each `Vault::claimPrize()` transaction will revert, but spend all the gas regardless (up to a little more than 150k gas per call, or `15_000_000 * 20*10^(-9) == 0.3 ETH` if there are 100 winners and a gas price of 20 gwei).

It is a possible scenario that claim auctions are only profitable at the very end of the draw duration as gas prices may spike, prize pools may be small for a certain draw and/or several start auctions may fail (each one taking at most an `auctionDuration`).

## Impact

Bots incur very significant costs as it is not checked if the correct `drawId` is being claimed, so each `Vault::claimPrize()` will revert.

## Recommendation

Receive the `drawId` as argument and validate that it matches the `_lastAwardedDrawId` of the `PrizePool`.
