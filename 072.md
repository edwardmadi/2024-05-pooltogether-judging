# Vault can auction off yield for an incorrect price

## Summary
The `lastAuctionAt` variable is set incorrectly.
## Vulnerability Detail
When deploying the `LiquidationPair` the `lastAuctionAt` is set to the `block.timestamp` in the constructor. This indicates that the auction starts as soon as the LiquidationPair is deployed. If the pair is deployed a lot earlier than the first yield auction happens on the vault, it could auction off yield for a very low price.

The amount of tokens that a user needs to provide will lower as time passes on.

In case of a very large `elapsedTime` the price could be too low for the amount of yield the liquidator will receive. This will cause a loss for the vault as it will sell the yield for less than it is worth. This scenario can happen only for the first yield auction on the vault if the owner of the vault sets the predeployed liquidation pair on the vault too late. (eg. deploy liq pair and after a day set it as a liq pair for the vault)
## Impact
Yield will be auctioned off for less than its worth.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only start the auction on the vault when the first deposit happens on a vault, or when the `liquidationPair` is set on a vault.
## Coded POC
Add this test to the `TpdaLiquidationPair.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-path ./test/TpdaLiquidationPair.t.sol -vvv`

```solidity
function test_computePrice_Test() public {
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10);
    console2.log("Price at the start:", pair.computeExactAmountIn(0));

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 hours);
    console2.log("Price after 1 hour:", pair.computeExactAmountIn(0));

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 hours);
    console2.log("Price after 1 day :", pair.computeExactAmountIn(0));
}
```

```solidity
[PASS] test_computePrice_Test() (gas: 19508)
Logs:
  Price at the start: 3600000000000000000
  Price after 1 hour: 9972299168975069
  Price after 1 day : 399955560493278
