# The depositors of the vault with tokens with more than 18 decimals like `YAMv2` are unable to withdraw their shutdown balance due to an overflow error despite of large contribution of the vault to the `PrizePool`

## Summary

When the `PrizePool` is shutdowned, users can withdraw their shutdown balance by calling the [withdrawShutdownBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/1aa1b8c028b659585e4c7a6b9b652fb075f86db3/pt-v5-prize-pool/src/PrizePool.sol#L938-L949) function. It calculates the shutdown balance of the user with contribution of the vault to the `PrizePool` during `grandPrizePeriodDraws` days, time weighted balance of the user during `grandPrizePeriodDraws` days and remained balance of `PrizePool`. However, users who deposited tokens with more than 18 decimals like `YAMv2` into the vaults are unable to withdraw their shutdown balance due to an overflow error in the `shutdownBalanceOf` function despite of large contribution of the vault to the `PrizePool`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the `PrizePool` is shutdown, users can withdraw their shutdown balance by calling the [withdrawShutdownBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/1aa1b8c028b659585e4c7a6b9b652fb075f86db3/pt-v5-prize-pool/src/PrizePool.sol#L938-L949) function.
The shutdown balance of the user is calculated from the [shutdownBalanceOf()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/1aa1b8c028b659585e4c7a6b9b652fb075f86db3/pt-v5-prize-pool/src/PrizePool.sol#L904-L932) function at `L942`.

```solidity
    File: pt-v5-prize-pool\src\PrizePool.sol
    938:   function withdrawShutdownBalance(address _vault, address _recipient) external returns (uint256) {
    939:     if (!isShutdown()) {
    940:       revert PrizePoolNotShutdown();
    941:     }
@>  942:     uint256 balance = shutdownBalanceOf(_vault, msg.sender);
    943:     _withdrawalObservations[_vault][msg.sender] = _totalAccumulator.newestObservation();
    944:     if (balance > 0) {
    945:       prizeToken.safeTransfer(_recipient, balance);
    946:       _totalWithdrawn += uint128(balance);
    947:     }
    948:     return balance;
    949:   }
```

It first calculates the shutdown portion of the user at L916 and available balance of the `PrizePool` at `L929`. Then it finally calculates shutdown balance of the user at `L931`
```solidity
    File: pt-v5-prize-pool\src\PrizePool.sol
    904:   function shutdownBalanceOf(address _vault, address _account) public returns (uint256) {
            [...]
    913:     // if we haven't withdrawn yet, add the portion of the shutdown balance
    914:     if ((withdrawalObservation.available + withdrawalObservation.disbursed) == 0) {
    915:       (balance, withdrawalObservation) = getShutdownInfo();
@>  916:       shutdownPortion = computeShutdownPortion(_vault, _account); 
    917:       _shutdownPortions[_vault][_account] = shutdownPortion;
    918:     } else {
    919:       shutdownPortion = _shutdownPortions[_vault][_account];
    920:     }
    921: 
    922:     if (shutdownPortion.denominator == 0) {
    923:       return 0;
    924:     }
    925: 
    926:     // if there are new rewards
    927:     // current "draw id to award" observation - last withdraw observation
    928:     Observation memory newestObs = _totalAccumulator.newestObservation();
    929:     balance += (newestObs.available + newestObs.disbursed) - (withdrawalObservation.available + withdrawalObservation.disbursed);
    930: 
@>  931:     return (shutdownPortion.numerator * balance) / shutdownPortion.denominator; 
    932:   }
```

The shutdown portion of the user is calculated from contribution of the vault to the `PrizePool` and the time weighted average balance of the user during `grandPrizePeriodDraws` days which is usually 365 days.
```solidity
    File: pt-v5-prize-pool\src\PrizePool.sol
    873:   function computeShutdownPortion(address _vault, address _account) public view returns (ShutdownPortion memory) {
    874:     uint24 drawIdPriorToShutdown = getShutdownDrawId() - 1;
    875:     uint24 startDrawIdInclusive = computeRangeStartDrawIdInclusive(drawIdPriorToShutdown, grandPrizePeriodDraws); // @audit-info grandPrizePeriodDraws is usually 365 days
    876: 
@>  877:     (uint256 vaultContrib, uint256 totalContrib) = _getVaultShares( // @audit-info decimal of vaultContrib is 18 
    878:       _vault,
    879:       startDrawIdInclusive,
    880:       drawIdPriorToShutdown
    881:     );
    882: 
@>  883:     (uint256 _userTwab, uint256 _vaultTwabTotalSupply) = getVaultUserBalanceAndTotalSupplyTwab( // @audit-info decimal of vaultContrib is greater than 18 (24 for YAMv2)
    884:       _vault,
    885:       _account,
    886:       startDrawIdInclusive,
    887:       drawIdPriorToShutdown
    888:     );
    889: 
    890:     if (_vaultTwabTotalSupply == 0) {
    891:       return ShutdownPortion(0, 0);
    892:     }
    893: 
@>  894:     return ShutdownPortion(vaultContrib * _userTwab, totalContrib * _vaultTwabTotalSupply);
    895:   }
```

The shutdown balance of of the user is calculate from `L931`.
```solidity
    931:     return (shutdownPortion.numerator * balance) / shutdownPortion.denominator; 
```
`shutdownPortion.numerator` is multiplication of `vaultContrib` and `_userTwab`.
So the shutdown balance becomes as following.
```solidity
             return (vaultContrib * _userTwab * balance) / (totalContrib * _vaultTwabTotalSupply); 
```
Here, the decimal of `vaultContrib` is 18.
As the variable `vaultContrib` is the amount of contribution to the `PrizePool` during `grandPrizePeriodDraws` days which is usually 365 days. If the vault contributed a lot to the `PrizePool`, it can be large value. Furthermore this value can be increased by calling the [contributePrizeTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/1aa1b8c028b659585e4c7a6b9b652fb075f86db3/pt-v5-prize-pool/src/PrizePool.sol#L412-L422) function.

The variable `_userTwab` represents time weighted average balance of the user during `grandPrizePeriodDraws` days. Its decimal is greater than 18 (24 for YAMv2).

The variable `balance` is the available amount of `prizetoken` in the `PrizePool` that is entitiled to be withdrawn in case of shutdown which is also large value.

As a result, the multiply of three variables overflows and the [shutdownBalanceOf()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/1aa1b8c028b659585e4c7a6b9b652fb075f86db3/pt-v5-prize-pool/src/PrizePool.sol#L904-L932) function is reverted.

## Impact
The depositors of the vault with tokens with more than 18 decimals like `YAMv2` are unable to withdraw their shutdown balance.

## Recommendation

Vaults that uses tokens with more than 18 decimals should be accounted carefully.
