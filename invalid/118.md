# Result of transfer / transferFrom not checked

## Summary
no check on the transfer call in withdraw function.
## Vulnerability Detail
 function withdraw(address payable _to) external onlyCreator returns (uint256) {
        uint balance = address(this).balance;
        _to.transfer(balance);
        return balance;
    }

## Impact
A call to transferFrom or transfer is frequently done without checking the results. For certain ERC20 tokens, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of "false" is returned. So its important to check this. If you don't you could mint tokens without have received sufficient tokens to do so. So you could loose funds.

Its also a best practice to check this. See below for example where the result isn't checked.

## Recommendation
Always check the result of transferFrom and transfer.
use safetransfer instead of transfer.
