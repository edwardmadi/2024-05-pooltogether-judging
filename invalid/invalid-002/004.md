# The `creator` role can withhold setting a `DrawManager` to DOS the protocol

## Summary
The `creator` role can withhold setting a `DrawManager` to DOS the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol clearly states the following
>The only permissioned role in the codebase is the Prize Vault owner. 

There exists a role in the `prizePool` contract called `creator`. The role is set in the constructor like this

```solidity
constructor(
    ConstructorParams memory params
  )
  ...
  ...
  creator = params.creator;
  ...

```

Only the `creator` can call the important `setDrawManager()` function to set the DrawManager contract

```solidity
function setDrawManager(address _drawManager) external {
    if (msg.sender != creator) { //@audit the creator can set a malicious drawManager
      revert OnlyCreator();
    }
    if (drawManager != address(0)) {
      revert DrawManagerAlreadySet();
    }
    drawManager = _drawManager;

    emit SetDrawManager(_drawManager);
  }
```

The vulnerability is in the restricted creator not setting a DrawManager by not calling `setDrawManager`

At this point the protocol is useless as without a DrawManager the protocol will not work

## Impact
PrizePool needs to be redeployed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
maybe call the function in the constructor to ensure it is set
