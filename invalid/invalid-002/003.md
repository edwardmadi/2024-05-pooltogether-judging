# the `creator` role can set a malicious drawManager

## Summary
the `creator` role can set a malicious drawManager 

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol clearly states the following
>The only permissioned role in the codebase is the Prize Vault owner. 

There exists a role in the `prizePool` contract called `creator`. The role is set in the constructor like this

```solidity
constructor(
    ConstructorParams memory params
  )
  ...
  ...
  creator = params.creator;
  ...

```

Only the `creator` can call the important `setDrawManager()` function to set the DrawManager contract

```solidity
function setDrawManager(address _drawManager) external {
    if (msg.sender != creator) { //@audit the creator can set a malicious drawManager
      revert OnlyCreator();
    }
    if (drawManager != address(0)) {
      revert DrawManagerAlreadySet();
    }
    drawManager = _drawManager;

    emit SetDrawManager(_drawManager);
  }
```

The vulnerability is in setting a malicious DrawManager contract. This can have a variety of impacts depending on what the attacker wants:
1. The DrawManager contract does not interact with Witnet to get random numbers, instead it will provide random numbers from the attacker's source to ensure they always win prizes

2. DrawManager's crucial functions are set to revert, this completely DOS's the protocol

## Impact
attacker uses a malicious DrawManager to unfairly win prizes

complete DOS of the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol should deploy the DrawManager themselves and set it directly in the prizePool constructor
