# deadline can be current block.timestamp during swaps leading to maximum price slippage

## Summary
The function `TpdaLiquidationRouter.swapExactAmountOut()` is used to swap vault yield for the prize pool token and then contribute it into the prize pool on behalf of the vault. The caller can set `_deadline == block.timestamp` which is bad.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the caller sets the `_deadline` to be the current `block.timestamp`, then proposers and sequencers can hold the transaction and execute it in any future block and cause maximum slippage. This is because the current timestamp is always valid for any block.

The slippage in this scenario is the change of price via `TpdaLiquidaitonPair._computePrice()`. As `elapsedTime` increases because the order is being held out until a future block, this decreases the `price` returned, which is `swapAmountIn`, which is `_amountIn` for `PrizeVault.verifyTokensIn()`, which is the amount of prize tokens actually contributed through `prizePool.contributePrizeTokens(address(this), _amountIn);`. The vault will get credited for less tokens than expected, up to the maximum slippage amount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Disallow the timestamp from being the deadline. Also, you could force a minimum deadline of 10 seconds to 5 minutes or more depending on preference.

```diff
// TpdaLiquidationRouter.sol
-        if (block.timestamp > _deadline) {
+        if (block.timestamp >= _deadline {
            revert SwapExpired(_deadline);
        }
```
