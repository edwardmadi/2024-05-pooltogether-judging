# `yieldFeeBalance` cannot be claimed once `TWAB_SUPPLY_LIMIT` is reached

## Summary
`yieldFeeBalance` cannot be claimed once `TWAB_SUPPLY_LIMIT` is reached

And an attacker can prevent the `yieldFeeRecipient` from claiming their `yieldFeeBalance`

## Vulnerability Detail
Every vault has a `yieldFeeBalance` that accumulates every time a liquidation occurs.

Later the designated `yieldFeeRecipient` can claim the `yieldFeeBalance` by calling `claimYieldFeeShares()`

The problem is that once the `TWAB_SUPPLY_LIMIT` is reached, calls to `claimYieldFeeShares()` will revert

The function causing the overflow is `TwabLib.increaseBalances`, it is deep in the flow of `claimYieldFeeShares`

`claimYieldFeeShares` ==> `_mint` ==> `twabController.mint` ==> ... ==> `_increaseTotalSupplyBalances` ==> `TwabLib.increaseBalances`

```solidity
function increaseBalances(
    uint32 PERIOD_LENGTH,
    uint32 PERIOD_OFFSET,
    Account storage _account,
    uint96 _amount,
    uint96 _delegateAmount
  )
    internal
    ...
    ...
    accountDetails.balance += _amount;
    ...
    ...
  }
```

The problem is that `accountDetails.balance` is a type uint96, therefore when the `TWAB_SUPPLY_LIMIT` is reached, accountDetails.balance = type(uint96).max

Therefore if accountDetails.balance = type(uint96).max AND _amount > 0 then `claimYieldFeeShares()` will revert

This problem will occur naturally when vaults fill up

But also an attacker can take advantage of this in the following steps

1. Identify vaults with tokens like SHIBE or LADYS that are not yet full and have a non zero `yieldFeeBalance`
2. deposit into the vault such that `TWAB_SUPPLY_LIMIT` is reached
3. At this point the `yieldFeeBalance` that was accumulated can never be claimed 

## Impact
`yieldFeeBalance` cannot be claimed

Attacker has caused the `yieldFeeRecipient` to have locked funds and essentially lose them

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Redesign `claimYieldFeeShares` so they can always claim it
