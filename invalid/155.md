# Missing Authorization Check in `delegate` Function

## Summary
The `delegate` function allows `msg.sender` to initiate a delegation from `_vault` to `_to` without verifying if `msg.sender` has the necessary permissions or role to perform this action on behalf of _vault.
## Vulnerability Detail
Any user can call the `delegate` function and delegate authority from `_vault` to any address, leading to unauthorized changes
## Impact
This can lead to unauthorized users being able to delegate authority
## Code Snippet
  function delegate(address _vault, address _to) external {
    _delegate(_vault, msg.sender, _to);
  }

Ensure that `msg.sender` has the necessary permissions to delegate on behalf of `_vault` and include an error to handle unauthorized calls.
