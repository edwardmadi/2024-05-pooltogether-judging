# Reorgs attack issue while deploying using create , will result in fund lost for Requester contract

## Summary
The Requester contract is used to request RNG from `witnet` protocol, However The Requester contract is deployed using create op-code which is vulnerable to re orgs attacks and also hold the fee amount left.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user request for new RNG the Protocol checks that if the user has requester deployed if not then the protocol deployed requester contract using create op-code after this deployment the newly created requester contract is used to request new RNG from `witnet` and `witnet` return the left amount to the newly deployed request contract has it sends the request to `witnet` contract.

```solidity
2024-05-pooltogether/pt-v5-rng-witnet/src/RngWitnet.sol:51
51:     function getRequestor(address user) public returns (Requestor) {
52:         Requestor requestor = requestors[user];
53:         if (address(requestor) == address(0)) {
54:             requestor = new Requestor(); 
55:             requestors[user] = requestor;
56:         }
57:         return requestor;
58:     }
```
The request Function call :
```solidity
/home/aman/Desktop/audits/2024-05-pooltogether/pt-v5-rng-witnet/src/RngWitnet.sol:85
85:     function requestRandomNumber(uint256 rngPaymentAmount) public payable returns (uint32 requestId, uint256 lockBlock, uint256 cost) {
86:         Requestor requestor = getRequestor(msg.sender);
87:         unchecked {
88:             requestId = ++lastRequestId; // @audit-issue : will overflow
89:             lockBlock = block.number;
90:         }
91:         requests[requestId] = lockBlock;
92:         cost = requestor.randomize{value: msg.value}(rngPaymentAmount, witnetRandomness);
93: 
94:         emit RandomNumberRequested(requestId, msg.sender, rngPaymentAmount, cost);
95:     }
```
`92:` it will submit request to witnet via newly created requester. The amount left will be sent back to new Requester. Note that for new Requester the deployment and submission of request happen in same block.
Re-orgs is a known issue in Ethereum and other EVM compatible protocols and one depth re-orgs is pretty common. 
Alice Tries to request new RNG for the first time.
1. The Alice calls `requestRandomNumber` function to generate new RNG.
2. The contract deploy new Request instance for Alice.
3.  The new Request contract submit the transaction to `witnet`.
4. The `Witnet` add request to its state and return the remaining `Funds` to new Request contract.
5. Execution completed.
6. Block re-orgs, Alice will not be able to withdraw her `funds`

## Impact
The user will lost the funds locked in `Requester` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
deployed the contract with `create2` op-code and use the user address as a salt. it is already done with the `PrizeVault` contract.
