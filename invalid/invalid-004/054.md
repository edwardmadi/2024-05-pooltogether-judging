# Since no deadline is set, `startDraw` will cause the user to suffer losses

## Summary

Since no deadline is set, `startDraw` will cause the user to suffer losses.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `startDraw` allows users to start a draw using the random number. Users could get rewards after `finishDraw` is called. The amount of the reward is determined by the ElapsedTime from the close time of the previous request or draw. However, due to network latency etc., `startDraw` may be executed after an unexpected amount of time. If DrawId happens to increase by 1 during this period, the user's reward will drop sharply.

For example, the firstDrawOpensAt = 100 and drawPeriodSeconds = 10. When block.timestamp = 119, the DrawId = 1, user calls the function startDraw. Since 9/10 periods have passed, there will be a generous reward. However, the function startDraw may be executed actually when block.timestamp = 121. The result is that the rewards will become very small (only 1/10 of the period has passed) due to the increase of DrawId.

## Impact

## Recommendation

Add a deadline parameter or an expected elapsed time parameter to protect the slippage.
