# `prizeVault.previewDeposit()` and `prizeVault.previewMint()` don't comply to ERC4626 standard

## Summary
`prizeVault.previewDeposit()` and `prizeVault.previewMint()` don't comply to ERC4626 standard
## Vulnerability Detail
```java
Is the codebase expected to comply with any EIPs? Can there be/are there any deviations from the specification?


PrizeVaults are expected to strictly comply with the ERC4626 standard.
```

According to the contest readme, the PrizeVaults is expected to _strictly comply_ with the ERC4626 standard **BUT** `prizeVault.previewDeposit()` and `prizeVault.previewMint()` don't.

`prizeVault.previewDeposit()` is supposed to round down and `prizeVault.previewMint()` is supposed to round up.

```java
Finally, EIP-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:

If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round down.

If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.

`prizeVault.previewDeposit()` and `prizeVault.previewMint()` are doing 1:1 on deposits and on mint

```solidity
   function previewDeposit(uint256 _assets) public pure returns (uint256) {
        // shares represent how many assets an account has deposited, so they are 1:1 on deposit
        return _assets;
    }
```

```solidity
   function previewMint(uint256 _shares) public pure returns (uint256) {
        // shares represent how many assets an account has deposited, so they are 1:1 on mint
        return _shares;
    }
```
