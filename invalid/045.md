# YieldVaults with fee on deposit are incompatible with the protocol

## Summary
YieldVaults with fee on deposit are incompatible with the protocol 

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the following check in `_depositAndMint()`

```solidity
function _depositAndMint(address _caller, address _receiver, uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares) internal {
    ...
    ...
    if (totalPreciseAssets() < _totalDebtBeforeMint + _shares) {
            revert LossyDeposit(totalPreciseAssets(), _totalDebtBeforeMint + _shares);
    ...
    ... 
```

If the YieldVault has a fee on deposit then `totalPreciseAssets <  _totalDebtBeforeMint + _shares`, therefore the check will revert

## Impact
The protocol cannot integrate with a lot of vaults.

Any user that created a PrizeVault with a fee on deposit YieldVault will waste a lot of money and time deploying the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fixing this is up to the protocol. I would recommend adding this as a known risk
