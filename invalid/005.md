# When a prizeVault owner changes the `yieldFeePercentage` it applies to all the yield accrued till this point leading to unfair losses to users

## Summary
When a prizeVault owner changes the `yieldFeePercentage` it applies to all the yield accrued till this point leading to unfair losses to users

## Vulnerability Detail
When a prizeVault owner changes the `yieldFeePercentage` it will apply the new `yieldFeePercentage` for yield that was accrued before the change.

This is unfair since users deposited to the pool knowing the vault had a certain lower `yieldFeePercentage`. The users have experienced a loss as the yield was generated when the `yieldFeePercentage` was lower, but it is accrued using a `yieldFeePercentage` that is higher. 

To be clear this does not involve a malicious prizeVault owner, changing the `yieldFeePercentage` is something any owner may do for whatever reason.

## Impact
Users will have a lower % chance of winning a draw than what they expected when they deposited to the vault

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a system where after the `yieldFeePercentage` is changed, a final liquidation of all existing yield occurs using the previous `yieldFeePercentage`, and then the  `yieldFeePercentage` is updated to the new value for future yield liquidations.

or

Implement a timelock system so that once `yieldFeePercentage` is changed, there is ample tiem for a final liqudiation with the previous `yieldFeePercentage`. after the set time `yieldFeePercentage` is updated to the new value.
