# TpdaLiquidationPair does not enforce the TpdaLiquidationRouter contract is the only possible caller for the swapExactAmountOut function

## Summary
The swapExactAmountOut function at the TpdaLiquidationPair contract swaps the given amount of output tokens for at most input tokens and was made to be utilized in the context of TpdaLiquidationRouter calls - it lacks any sort of access control to it, though.
## Vulnerability Detail
The lack of access control is potentially dangerous as malicious parties can implement contracts that have different implementations to the callbacks done at the TpdaLiquidationPair contract's logic.
The most important one is reentrancy, as the caller can remove the amountOut argument multiple times without having to pay for update auction prices.
## Impact
Users can reenter the swapExactAmountOut function to get better auction prices.
Malicious parties can execute arbitrary logic at the callbacks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to only allow the TdpaLiquidationRouter to call swapExactAmountOut at the TpdaLiquidationPair contract. Ensure the caller is the TdpaLiquidationRouter router otherwise revert.
