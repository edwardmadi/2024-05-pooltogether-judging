# Lack Of Zero Address Checks

## Summary
A lack of zero address checks might lead to `onlyLiquidationPair` sending tokens to a zero address causing those tokens to be effectively burned, lost forever or manipulating the contracts functionality. Or a function(s) that override `onlyLiquidationPair` to encounter the same problem. It is best to always check if the address is the zero address before performing critical operations like transferring funds, assigning ownership, or updating state variables. I am also pointing out that the function returns an empty string.
## Vulnerability Detail
If `onlyLiquidationPair` mistakenly sends tokens to the zero address, those assets are effectively burned or lost forever. Since no one controls the zero address, any funds sent there are irrecoverable
## Impact
Loss of tokens.
