# Inconsistent Total Supply Accounting in `_transferBalance` Function

## Summary
The total supply's `delegateBalance` can exceed the actual total supply balance in the `_transferBalance` function, leading to bad accounting in the total supply.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/ Mint balance if we're transferring from address(0)
      // Mint delegateBalance if we're transferring from address(0) and to an address not delegating to the sponsorship address
      // Mint delegateBalance if we're transferring from an address delegating to the sponsorship address to an address that isn't delegating to the sponsorship address
      if (
        _from == address(0) ||
        (_fromDelegate == SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS && _toDelegate != SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS)
      ) {
        _increaseTotalSupplyBalances(
          _vault,
          _from == address(0) ? _amount : 0,
          (_from == address(0) && _toDelegate != SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS) ||
            (_fromDelegate == SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS && _toDelegate != SPONSORSHIP_ADDRESS)
            ? _amount
            : 0
        );
      }
```      


Looking at the sniippet above, when transferring tokens from an address delegating to the sponsorship address to an address that isn't delegating to the sponsorship address, the `_transferBalance` function increases the total supply's `delegateBalance` by the transferred amount. But, this increase is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the total supply balance.

As a result, the total supply's `delegateBalance` can become greater than the actual total supply balance, causing inconsistencies in the total supply accounting.

Lets look at a scenario like this:
1. Assume the total supply balance is 1000 tokens and the total supply's `delegateBalance` is 500 tokens.
2. An address delegating to the sponsorship address transfers 100 tokens to an address that isn't delegating to the sponsorship address.
3. The `_transferBalance` function increases the total supply's `delegateBalance` by 100 tokens, making it 600 tokens.
4. However, the total supply balance remains at 1000 tokens.
5. Now, the total supply's `delegateBalance` (600 tokens) exceeds the actual total supply balance (1000 tokens).


## Impact
This causes incorrect accounting of the total supply and its delegated balance. It may allow the total supply's `delegateBalance` to exceed the actual total supply balance, causing issues with token transfers,  balance calculations, and other functions/part of the protocol that query these values

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure `delegateBalance` is always â‰¤ total supply balance. Also, the `_increaseTotalSupplyBalances` should include a check that ensure the resulting `delegateBalance` does not exceed the total supply balance. If the check fails, the function should revert the transaction to prevent the inconsistent state
