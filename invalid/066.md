# Avoiding Contradictions in Conditional Logic

## Summary
An if statement that is true won't stop the execution of subsequent else if statements, which can lead to contradictory outcomes if not carefully managed. 
## Vulnerability Detail
For the function `transferTokensOut` `if (_tokenOut == address(_asset))` is the same address as `else if (_tokenOut == address(this))` they will both execute.
## Impact
Both statements will be true. The second statement will overwrite the second statement.
