# Potential Revert on Insufficient Balance Transactions

## Summary
In the `_withdraw` function, if the contract doesn't have enough tokens, trying to transfer them with `_asset.safeTransfer` will make the transaction fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_withdraw` function, the contract attempts to transfer tokens using `_asset.safeTransfer`. If the contract does not have enough balance to fulfill the transfer, the `safeTransfer` function will cause the transaction to revert.
## Impact
It could lead to unexpected transaction failures.
## Code Snippet
    function _withdraw(address _receiver, uint256 _assets) internal {
        // The vault accumulates dust from rounding errors over time, so if we can fulfill the withdrawal from the
        // latent balance, we don't need to redeem any yield vault shares.
        uint256 _latentAssets = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (_assets > _latentAssets) {
            // The latent balance is subtracted from the withdrawal so we don't withdraw more than we need.
            uint256 _yieldVaultShares = yieldVault.previewWithdraw(_assets - _latentAssets);
            // Assets are sent to this contract so any leftover dust can be redeposited later.
            yieldVault.redeem(_yieldVaultShares, address(this), address(this));
        }
        if (_receiver != address(this)) {
            _asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, _assets);
        }
    }
