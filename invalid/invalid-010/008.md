# `depositWithPermit` does not work with some tokens like DAI

## Summary
`depositWithPermit` does not work with some tokens like DAI

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositWithPermit ` function is used as an alternate deposit flow for users that need to use a permit.

The protocol has stated 
>The protocol supports any standard ERC20 that does not have reentrancy or fee on transfer. USDT is also in scope.

AND in the test suite we can see they interact with DAI

This has proven that DAI is intended to interact with the protocol

The problem is that the DAI permit function has a nonce argument 
```solidity
function permit(address holder, address spender, uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry,
                    bool allowed, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external
    {
```

Therefore when `depositWithPermit ` makes the following call it will revert since the nonce is not provided

```solidity
IERC20Permit(address(_asset)).permit(_owner, address(this), _assets, _deadline, _v, _r, _s);
```


## Impact
The `depositWithPermit ` function will always revert when underyling token is DAI

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol could have a different implementation of the `depositWithPermit ` function for the special case of DAI

Or acknowledge this as an acceptable risk
