# Permit is not compatible with `DAI`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The prize vault allowed its user to deposit using a signature through `depositWithPermit()`, which allowed the user to only make a single transaction when depositing their funds to the vault. However, if the vault accept a `DAI` asset, and the user wanted to deposit their funds through `depositWithPermit()` their transaction will fail/revert. This can happen because the function signature that the `DAI`.permit has and IERC20Permit.permit has is different.
## Code Snippet

IERC20Permit = https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Permit.sol#L66-L74

```solidity
 function permit(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external;
```
ETHEREUM.DAI
```solidity
function permit(
        address holder, 
        address spender, 
        uint256 nonce, 
        uint256 expiry,
        bool allowed, 
        uint8 v, 
        bytes32 r, 
        bytes32 s
     ) external;
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For the special case of the `DAI` token, implement a different version of the permit function that includes a `nonce` variable.
