# Liquidator can avoid paying the yieldFee by liquidating small amounts

## Summary
Liquidator can avoid paying the yieldFee by liquidating small amounts

## Vulnerability Detail
A PrizeVault owner will set the `yieldFeePercentage` that they expect liquidators to pay when liquidating yield.

It is calculated in `transferTokensOut` by the following formulae 

```solidity
 _yieldFee = (_amountOut * FEE_PRECISION) / (FEE_PRECISION - _yieldFeePercentage) - _amountOut
```

A malicious liquidator can calculate an `_amountOut` such that for a given `_yieldFeePercentage`, the `_yieldFee` = 0

See the POC section for an example of a liquidator avoiding paying the fee    

## Impact
Liquidator has avoided paying the fee that they should pay to PrizeVault owners

If all liquidators employ this profitable strategy, PrizeVault owners will never accumulate `yieldFeeBalance`

## Proof of Concept

Paste the following code into remix

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity  ^0.8.2;

contract POC {
    function fee(uint256 _amountOut, uint256 _yieldFeePercentage) external pure returns (uint256 _yieldFee) {

    _yieldFee = (_amountOut * 10**9) / (10**9 - _yieldFeePercentage) - _amountOut;
  }
}
```

**Input the following**
_amountOut  = 9998
_yieldFeePercentage = 100000 (1 basis point)

**Output**
0: uint256: _yieldFee 0

Another Example

**Input the following**
_amountOut  = 998
_yieldFeePercentage = 1000000 (10 basis points)

**Output**
0: uint256: _yieldFee 0

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If `_yieldFeePercentage != 0` then if `_yieldFee = 0` revert the Tx
