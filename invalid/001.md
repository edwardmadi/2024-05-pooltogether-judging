# Vulnerable to fee-on-transfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Consistently check account balance before and after transfers for Fee-On-Transfer discrepancies. As arbitrary ERC20 tokens can be used, the amount here should be calculated every time to take into consideration a possible fee-on-transfer or deflation. Also, it's a good practice for the future of the solution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the balance before and after the transfer to calculate the received amount instead of assuming that it would be equal to the amount passed as a parameter
