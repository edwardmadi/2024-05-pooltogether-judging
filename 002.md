https://docs.witnet.io/smart-contracts/witnet-randomness-oracle/contract-addresses
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol stated that:
>We're interested to know if there will be any issues deploying the code as-is to any of these chains, and whether their opcodes fully support our application.
```solidity
    function randomize(uint value, IWitnetRandomness _witnetRandomness) external payable onlyCreator returns (uint256) {
        uint cost = _witnetRandomness.randomize{ value: value }();
        return cost;
    }

```

## Impact
Protocal would not work on those chains.
