# Use of `.transfer()` in `Requestor.withdraw()` will not work on zkSync

## Summary

`Requestor.withdraw()` uses `.transfer()` to transfer ETH to users, which does not work on zkSync. This causes funds to be stuck in the `Requestor` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contest's README states that ZKSync is one of the supported chains:

> We also plan on deploying to:
> - zkSync

`Requestor.withdraw()` uses `.transfer()` to transfer ETH instead of `.call()`:

[Requestor.sol#L36-L40](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-rng-witnet/blob/ac310b9deb1e53a547e53d69861495888d322ac3/src/Requestor.sol#L36-L40)

```solidity
function withdraw(address payable _to) external onlyCreator returns (uint256) {
    uint balance = address(this).balance;
    _to.transfer(balance);
    return balance;
}
```

However, `.transfer()` does not work on zkSync as it forwards fixed gas amount of 2300. This is due to zkSync's dynamic gas metering, explained in [zkSync's tweet](https://x.com/zksync/status/1644139364270878720). Note that this is not due to a future increase in opcodes costs.

Funds are transferred to the user's `Requestor` contract when they call [`RngWitnet.requestRandomNumber()`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-rng-witnet/blob/ac310b9deb1e53a547e53d69861495888d322ac3/src/RngWitnet.sol#L80-L95) to pay the RNG generation fee in [`WitnetRandomness.randomize()`](https://github.com/witnet/witnet-solidity-bridge/blob/2602a43e10b6dae3e681e567ce7de1c0204f4d5e/contracts/apps/WitnetRandomnessV2.sol#L369-L407). If the amount of ETH transferred is more than the actual fee or a randomize request was already sent in the current block, the excess ETH will be sent back to the `Requestor` contract:

[WitnetRandomnessV2.sol#L403-L406](https://github.com/witnet/witnet-solidity-bridge/blob/2602a43e10b6dae3e681e567ce7de1c0204f4d5e/contracts/apps/WitnetRandomnessV2.sol#L403-L406)

```solidity
// Transfer back unused funds:
if (_evmRandomizeFee < msg.value) {
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value - _evmRandomizeFee);
}
```

Since `withdraw()` does not work on zkSync, the refunded ETH will permanently be stuck in the `Requestor` contract.

## Impact

ETH refunded from `WitnetRandomness.randomize()` will be permanently stuck in the `Requestor` contract, causing a loss of funds for draw bots.

## Recommendation

Use `.call()` to send ETH instead of `.transfer()`:

```diff
  function withdraw(address payable _to) external onlyCreator returns (uint256) {
      uint balance = address(this).balance;
-     _to.transfer(balance);
+     (bool success, ) = _to.call{ value: balance }("");
+     require(success, "transfer failed");
      return balance;
  }
```
