# PUSH0 Opcode is not supported on linea chain

## Summary
PUSH0 Opcode is not supported on linea chain

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol has clearly stated they plan on deploying to Linea

They also state the following
>We're interested to know if there will be any issues deploying the code as-is to any of these chains, and whether their opcodes fully support our application.

All of the contracts in scope have the version pragma fixed to be compiled using Solidity 0.8.24. This uses the PUSH0 opcode, which is now the default EVM version in the compiler and the one being currently used to compile the project.

The bytecode will not be compatible with the linea chain

## Impact
The bytecode will not be compatible with the linea chain

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
From the linea docs
>The PUSH0 opcode compatibility was introduced in Solidity compiler version 0.8.20, which came after the London release. However, Linea currently supports Solidity compiler version 0.8.19 and lower, which aligns with the London release of the Ethereum mainnet. To resolve this issue, please recompile your contract using Solidity version 0.8.19 or lower.
