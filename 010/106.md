# PUSH0 is not supported by Linea

## Summary
Linea does not support the `PUSH0` op code and the contract have `^0.8.24` version of solidity. The contract will not be deployed on `Linea` Protocol.


## Vulnerability Detail

The ReadMe states that :
> We're interested to know if there will be any issues deploying the code as-is to any of these chains, and whether their opcodes fully support our application.

The Protocol is going to deploy the contract at `Linea` platform. Linea does not support the `PUSH0` op-code. it can be checked from [link](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences). 


## Impact
The contract will not be deployed on `Linea` as-is.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please make sure to follow the steps recommended by Linea team to deploy contract on Linea protocol.
> The PUSH0 opcode compatibility was introduced in Solidity compiler version 0.8.20, which came after the London release. However, Linea currently supports Solidity compiler version 0.8.19 and lower, which aligns with the London release of the Ethereum mainnet. To resolve this issue, recompile your contract using Solidity version 0.8.19 or lower.
