# `Claimer::_claim()` should reserve gas to finish execution, or it may revert unexpectedly, losing fees and gas for the claimer bot

## Summary

`Claimer::_claim()` calls `Vault::claimPrize()` inside a try/catch statement and forwards all available gas (63/64 actually), which may end up reverting due to OOG.

## Vulnerability Detail

Bots can claim on behalf of other users by using the `Claimer` smart contract. However, it always tries to claim prizes for a certain winner and prize index, regardless of the amount of gas left. This is very dangerous as it can lead to failed claims if any of the winners implements a hook with non deterministic gas costs (they may change since the transaction was simulated to when it is mined). Thus, claimer bots may have their claim transaction fail due to this, not claiming fees and incurring significant gas costs.

## Impact

Failed claim auction mechanism, leading to lost fees and gas costs by reverting due to OOG.

## Recommendation

The maximum amount of gas that can be used when claiming a prize should be precomputed, as well as the remaining gas required to finish execution in `Claimer::_claim()`. This way, a claimer bot will never fail to claim as if the gas limit is reached, claiming will just stop, instead of reverting and DoSing all other previous claims.
