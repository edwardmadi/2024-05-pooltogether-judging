# A malicious user could frontrun `PrizeVault.withdraw()` transferring asset directly into the `PrizeVault`

## Summary
`_latentAssets` in `PrizeVault._withdraw()` can be gamed to reduce `_yieldVaultShares` this can cause reverts.
```solidity
   function _withdraw(address _receiver, uint256 _assets) internal {
        // The vault accumulates dust from rounding errors over time, so if we can fulfill the withdrawal from the
        // latent balance, we don't need to redeem any yield vault shares.
        uint256 _latentAssets = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (_assets > _latentAssets) {
            // The latent balance is subtracted from the withdrawal so we don't withdraw more than we need.
            uint256 _yieldVaultShares = yieldVault.previewWithdraw(_assets - _latentAssets);//@audit-issue
            // Assets are sent to this contract so any leftover dust can be redeposited later.
            yieldVault.redeem(_yieldVaultShares, address(this), address(this));
        }
        if (_receiver != address(this)) {
            _asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, _assets);
        }
    }
```
## Vulnerability Detail
- Malicious USER A on Ethereum mainnet sees  USER B's call to `PrizeVault.withdraw()`  in the mempool

- Malicious USER A frontruns USER B's transaction by paying more gas and sends 1/2 of USER B's requested assets to withdraw.

- Now in `PrizeVault._withdraw()` Malicious USER A's deposit + latent balance of asset will likely be < USER B's requested assets to withdraw. 
```solidity
        if (_assets > _latentAssets) {
            // The latent balance is subtracted from the withdrawal so we don't withdraw more than we need.
            uint256 _yieldVaultShares = yieldVault.previewWithdraw(_assets - _latentAssets);//@audit-issue
            // Assets are sent to this contract so any leftover dust can be redeposited later.
            yieldVault.redeem(_yieldVaultShares, address(this), address(this));
        }
```
The issue lies in calling `yieldVault.previewWithdraw()` with __assets_ - _latentAssets_.

if USER B's requested assets to withdraw is 500, USER A sent 1/2 of 500.. so  __assets_ - _latentAssets_ will likely be _500 - 250.02_.  

**249.98** is what will be redeemed from the `yieldVault`, but USER B requested 500 assets to be withdrawn from the prizeVault. This will cause reverts due to insufficient balance for USER B as his intended 500 assets won't be available in the `PrizeVault` for withdrawal


**Pls note**: _The malicious individual doesn't really need to send 1/2 of the withdrawing user's funds, he just needs to make sure the EXACT specified asset amount to withdraw isn't redeemed from the yieldVault, which will cause reverts due to insufficient funds during transfer_

## Impact
A malicious user could frontrun `PrizeVault.withdraw()` transferring assets directly into the `PrizeVault` this will cause reverts due to insufficient balance for the user withdrawing

The malicious user can do it as many times as he wants, preventing users from withdrawing

Manual Review

## Recommendation
don't call `yieldVault.previewWithdraw()` with __assets_ - _latentAssets_, the latent balance of asset is supposed to be insignificant anyway
