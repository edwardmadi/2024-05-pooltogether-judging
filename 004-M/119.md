# Users may be unable to withdraw from their `Requestor` contract

## Summary
When withdrawing leftover ETH from `Requestor.sol`, the contract uses Solidityâ€™s unsafe `transfer()` to transfer the ETH to the caller.

## Vulnerability Detail
This function is known to have some critical drawbacks when the recipient of the funds is a smart contract, which can render ETH impossible to unlock. Specifically, the transfer may fail when the smart contract implements a payable fallback function that would use more than 2300 gas units.

## Impact
Users lose funds leftover in the `Requestor.sol` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()`:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(_to).call{value: balance}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed.");
```
