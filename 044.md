# An attacker can take advantage of a yield vault that made a loss, at the expense of all other users

## Summary
An attacker can take advantage of a yield vault that made a loss, at the expense of all other users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol intends to "socialize" losses to all users when a YieldVault experiences a significant loss. 

The protocol does this in the `previewWithdraw()` function when a user calls `withdraw()`

`withdraw()` ==> `previewWithdraw()` ==> `_convertToShares`

```solidity
function _convertToShares(
        uint256 _assets,
        uint256 _totalAssets,
        uint256 _totalDebt,
        Math.Rounding _rounding
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (_totalAssets >= _totalDebt) {
            return _assets;
        } else {
            // If the vault controls less assets than what has been deposited a share will be worth a
            // proportional amount of the total assets. This can happen due to fees, slippage, or loss
            // of funds in the underlying yield vault.
            return _assets.mulDiv(_totalDebt, _totalAssets, _rounding);
        }
    }
```

If the YieldVault experiences a significant loss then `totalAssets < _totalDebt`, therefore the `else` block will go through to socialize the loss.

The vulnerability is that an attacker can frontrun a YieldVault entering a loss state by withdrawing from the PrizeVault, this withdraw will have `totalAssets > _totalDebt` therefore the `if` block will go through, the attacker will get more assets than they should since the `if` block will go through for them.

## Impact
Attacker unfairly avoids the protocol's intended loss socialization

Attacker has exacerbated other user's losses

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This is not easy to mitigate, this should be a risk communicated to users.
