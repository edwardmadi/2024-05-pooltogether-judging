# Inconsistent TWAB Calculation for Zero Balances in TwabController

## Summary

The `TwabController` contract does not explicitly handle the case where a user's balance becomes zero, which could lead to inconsistencies in the calculation of time-weighted average balances (TWABs) and potentially affect the fairness of prize distribution in the associated prize pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `TwabController` contract is responsible for tracking the TWABs of users in a prize pool. It does this by recording observations of users' balances at regular intervals. However, when a user's balance becomes zero due to a transfer or burn, the contract does not explicitly record a new observation with a balance of zero. This could lead to a situation where the user's TWAB is calculated based on their last non-zero balance, even though their current balance is zero.

## Impact

This could lead to several issues:

*   **Incorrect TWAB Calculation:** The TWAB for a user with a zero balance could be overestimated, leading to an unfair advantage in the prize pool.
*   **Inefficient Storage:** The contract could continue to store outdated observations for users with zero balances, wasting storage space.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether/blob/main/pt-v5-twab-controller/src/TwabController.sol#L752
```solidity
// (Relevant code snippets from TwabController.sol)

function _decreaseBalances(
    address _vault,
    address _user,
    uint96 _amount,
    uint96 _delegateAmount
  ) internal {
    TwabLib.Account storage _account = userObservations[_vault][_user];

    (
      ObservationLib.Observation memory _observation,
      bool _isNewObservation,
      bool _isObservationRecorded,
      TwabLib.AccountDetails memory accountDetails
    ) = TwabLib.decreaseBalances(
        PERIOD_LENGTH,
        PERIOD_OFFSET,
        _account,
        _amount,
        _delegateAmount,
        "TC/observation-burn-lt-delegate-balance"
      );

    // Always emit the balance change event
    if (_amount != 0 || _delegateAmount != 0) {
      emit DecreasedBalance(_vault, _user, _amount, _delegateAmount);
    }

    // Conditionally emit the observation recorded event
    if (_isObservationRecorded) {
      emit ObservationRecorded(
        _vault,
        _user,
        accountDetails.balance,
        accountDetails.delegateBalance,
        _isNewObservation,
        _observation
      );
    }
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `_decreaseBalances` function (and potentially other relevant functions like `burn` and `transfer`) to explicitly check if the resulting balance is zero after a decrease. If so, record a new observation with a balance of zero. This would ensure that the TWAB calculation is accurate and that storage is used efficiently.

```solidity
// (Modified code snippet)

function _decreaseBalances(
    address _vault,
    address _user,
    uint96 _amount,
    uint96 _delegateAmount
  ) internal {
    // ... (rest of the function)

    // Check if the resulting balance is zero
    if (accountDetails.balance == 0) {
        // Record a new observation with a balance of zero
        (
          _observation,
          _isNewObservation,
          _isObservationRecorded,
          accountDetails
        ) = TwabLib.recordObservation(PERIOD_LENGTH, PERIOD_OFFSET, _account, 0, accountDetails.delegateBalance);
    }

    // ... (rest of the function)
  }
```

This modification would prevent the accidental loss of funds and improve the overall security of the `TwabERC20` contract.
