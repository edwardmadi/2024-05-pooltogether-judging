# `Claimable` is vulnerable to return gas bomb attacks, DoSing claiming for all other winners

## Summary

`Claimer::claimPrizes()` loops through a list of `_winners` and `_prizeIndices` to claim, but they may all be DoSed by a single winner returning a gas bomb attack in the `Claimer` hook.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Claimer::claimPrizes()` receives the list of winners and prize indices and in `Claimer::_claim()` claims the prize for each winner by calling `Vault::claimPrize()`. It does so inside a try/catch statement to avoid getting DoSed by failed claims.

`Vault` inherits `Claimable`, which calls hooks set by users before and after claiming the prize from the `PrizePool`, forwarding only a specific amount of gas, `HOOK_GAS` to prevent attackers from making the transaction revert by running out of gas.

However, attackers can perform a return gas bomb attack and make the transaction run out of gas anyway, as the hook is called via `_hooks[_winner].implementation.beforeClaimPrize{ gas: HOOK_GAS }`, which returns the `_hookData` as bytes memory and can run out of gas while copying into memory.

## Impact

DoSed claiming for all winners in the `Claimer::claimPrizes()` transaction and failure of the user that triggered the function to retrieve claiming fees.

## Recommendation

Call the hooks using [ExcessivelySafeCall](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/ExcessivelySafeCall), which protects against gas bomb attacks. The fix is essentially limiting the return data the hook may send.
